          <p>I’m about three hours into the RPG Disco Elysium, and it’s pretty good so far.  The game feels so complex that I don’t know if three hours is even enough for an accurate first impress, but here we are.</p>

<p>The game is thankfully as weird as I hoped it would be.  (The fear with games that sell themselves on their strangeness is that they just come off as quirky. In that freshman roommate kind of way.) The system of your skills being voices in your head with their own agency is actually smoother than I would have expected.  It just sort of feels like you’re playing a table top RPG and the GM is feeding you information as they do.</p>

<p>But I knew I was going to like the game when it opened with me having to talk my lizard brain in to letting me out of an alcohol induced coma.</p>

<p>I’ll keep you posted as I play more with the game, but it’s memorable so far.</p>

          <p>So I’m currently downloading a new game to my computer: Disco Elysium.  Which students of obscure indie games will know as that game where you play as a drunk detective and the skills are all weird.</p>

<p>That’s about all I know too because I haven’t played it yet, but it’s about done being downloaded.  So if I drop off the world for a while, you know why.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to give computer games another shot because I actually have a computer that will run them, and they used to be my favorite part of video games.  They were always more deep and stranger than anything I could get on console.</p>

<p>I feel I may have stacked the deck in my PC’s favor with Disco Elysium.</p>

          <p>So I may be becoming an old man.  I was scrolling Facebook and the algorithm and figured out that I will always stop whenever there’s a video of someone making a craft, or building a table, or something.  I never told it this.  I never shared anything like this, or clicked the like button on a video. It just figured it out from my scrolling behavior.</p>

<p>It figured out that I have turned into the millennial equivalent of an old man watching This Old House.</p>

<p>And yes, I did almost lose my terminal interface, but you know, I fixed it at the last second.</p>

          <p>So I’ve been living with my <a href="https://goodmorningsoda.com/2020/07/27/new-productivity-system/">new productivity system</a> for about a week and a half now. It’s been good but I still need to work some bugs out of the system.  I wasn’t able to clear off everything from The Board last week.  I think this was due to my ambition problem whenever I implement a new system. I try to put EVERY TASK EVER IN MY LIFE into it and I get overloaded and explode.</p>

<p>So I need to live with the system for a while before I really start seeing changes.  This is why I haven’t really written in up yet, so that I can get it into a better state before explaining how it works. Or just drop it because it doesn’t work for me.</p>

<p>For now, I just have to keep trying, but The Board has been reset, and we’ll see where the rest of the week takes us.</p>

          <p>I’m about to complain about a hyper-specific feature of Facebook, so if that’s not your thing, I’d suggest skipping this post.</p>

<p>I was just on Facebook - again, I know, big mistake - and they have a new feature that tells you when you are offline.  I only know about this feature because I keep getting false positives from it when it goes off right after my computer wakes up from sleep.  It would appear my computer reconnecting to the wifi from sleep mode is not fast enough for an already cached website and it feels the need to inform me.</p>

<p>Why on Earth does this exist? Why would you code in a system for your website to ping through a user’s browser and look at its connectivity to the Internet? There is no way that this is a requested feature.  There is no user that cares to know from an individual website that their computer has lost web connectivity when all they are trying to do is scroll already cached data.</p>

<p>I can see it being mildly useful the site to do this check when the user tries to post something.  That would be useful. “Hey, you can’t post this right now and I know the reason: your computer isn’t online.” But it throws up this notification while you are scrolling the front page.</p>

<p>This means they are doing to check too much.  This means the information is be collected and returned to Facebook when the computer re-establishes connection with the web.  Since there is no user who could want this kind of feature, chances are the data is not being collected for our benefit.</p>

<p>Just a thought.  End rant. You may now return to your day. Thanks for reading.</p>

          <p>I have five huge deluxe edition comic collections sitting on my coffee table unread, mocking me. I’m still making my way through 100 Bullets and it’s still very good.  There’s just a lot of it. There’s 100 issues because Brian Azzarello likes to be cute.  I’ve read over 60 issues of it, which is where a lot of Vertigo series liked to end.  This means that the story is feeling like it’s dragging just because it’s now outside of the normal rhythm.</p>

<p>And after that I have Y The Last Man lined up.</p>

<p>So Am I reading any of this? Fuck no, I’m on like looking at volumes of Judge Dredd.  It’s a comic I’ve always lusted after as it’s hard to get here in the states.  Or at least it was when I was a kid and really wanted to read it. Now they’ve collected it into huge volumes that I can go through in chronological order.</p>

<p>Because I need a bigger backlog.</p>

          <p>So I’m trying out another productivity system.  Anyone who knows me is probably rolling their eyes because productivity systems is something of a hobby of mine, which is a nice way of saying I read a lot without doing much.  The thing that’s unique about this one is that I’m building it myself out of bits from other systems.  Just the bits I like and I’m exited to use.</p>

<p>And that’s about all I’m going to say on the subject right now.  The thing I don’t want to do is lay everything out and have the system need to be changed or I abandon it in three days as is normally the case with these things. So I’ll hopefully go into more detail in a few months.  The last specific I’ll give is that it involves a cork board which shall here by be referred to as The Board.</p>

<p>It might seem weird to be implementing something like this in the middle of the world falling apart, but I have to try something because my current plan of stress watching YouTube isn’t getting me where I want to be.  But if this does fall apart, I will try to be gentle with myself.</p>
