<p>Still hacking away at the email.  In the late 00’s there was a term called “bacon” that was spam that you signed up for.  It fell out of usage quickly but it applies here. I have tens of thousands of bacon emails that I’ve had to sift through.  I have uncovered and processed some actionable emails from my burner email address that I never check.</p>

<p>I’ve also installed even more email filters in Gmail so I should actually start seeing actionable things easier from that account. But Gmail makes it just tedious enough to make filters that you don’t want to do it all the time.  So I might be back in this boat in a few months.  We’ll see.  Google makes this a bit of a moving target.</p>
