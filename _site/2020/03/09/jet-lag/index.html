<p>Daylight Savings Time happened yesterday, although I’ve never counted that Sunday as the first day.  Monday is always the first day of Daylight Savings Time to me.  The thing isn’t real until you have to get up at the wrong time with shit to do.  What’s this time shift look like when you have an agenda?</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea why we as a global society willingly give ourselves jet lag two times a year.  Yeah, yeah, I know. “Something, something. Farmers.” But I’ve reached a point in my life where the only people I let say that to me are people who actually know farmers.</p>

<p>Do you know farmers? Have you farmed? Can you grow anything?</p>

<p>See. Jet lag. Makes people grumpy.</p>
