<p>One thing about posting the output of neofetch on your blog is that you make it known to the entire world that you haven’t turned off your computer in over 60 days.</p>

<p>So I restarted the computer, and since I was doing that anyway, I decided it was a good idea to update it as well. It then started showing signs of giving up the ghost.</p>

<p>This means the urgency of getting all my configs backed up just raised a little bit.  Not that I think my computer is going to randomly die, I just don’t know how many more updates it has in it.</p>
