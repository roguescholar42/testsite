<p>The last two days have been fairly pleasant and I’ve actually popped out of my hole while the Day Star was still high in the air.</p>

<p>However, it’s getting to the point where every time the weather gets nice all I can think about is “the world is dying.” So yeah, I’m cheery today.</p>

<p>Have some planing for my D&amp;D session coming up and might pick at some more problems I have with this site. Also, might get all my Internet locations around if I can be asked.</p>
