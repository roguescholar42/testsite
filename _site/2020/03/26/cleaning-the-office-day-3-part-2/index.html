<p>Operation: Oh-Shit-I-Need-To-Clean-The-Floor seems to have gone well. The comics are now in storage and I have a lot more space in the office closet.  For what? Fuck knows, that’s not my job right now.</p>

<p>I’m just trying to clean up this space so it isn’t depressing to be in here and do some actual work. More on the actual work at a later date.</p>
