<p>I’ve been making maps this entire day and lost track of time.  Almost didn’t make a post today.  It’s been raining here all day and it’s really only been good for thinking about some other world and making a map for it.</p>

<p>I’m not usually this kind of guy, but I’ve been enjoying the new Inkarnate interface and I can finally make it do what I want it to do.</p>

<p>So that’s good.</p>
