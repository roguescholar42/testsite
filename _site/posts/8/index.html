          <p>It’s a lazy Sunday, which means I’ve been more productive than I’ve been all week, I just haven’t left my bedroom much.</p>

<p>I did the one thing I wanted to get done today, which was get the blog a proper URL.  Now I can actually start handing it out without the embarrassment that I’m building this site with my bare hands on the cheap.</p>

<p>The light here in Witch City is starting to wane and I think it would be wise to go outside before the cold, brutal blanket of night comes in and any activity seem like something, “best left for tomorrow.”</p>

          <p>It’s that weird, misty day that only appears every four years because the Earth can’t be asked to revolve around the sun in a way that’s convenient to us with our arbitrary calendar system.</p>

<p>I like that. The earth is going to do what it wants and we just have to keep up with our measuring systems.  And we aren’t doing the job at 100%, so we get a slightly longer year every now and then. One last day of February.</p>

<p>There’s some more coding research that I’m hoping to get done today, and I’d like to get a few more things taken care of on the backend of this blog before I’m willing to call it’s setup complete. Luckily, I have an extra day.</p>

          <p>Today was the last day I’ll be spending at PAX East this year. The show was great and everyone there is friendly and there is always a party atmosphere, which is more than can be said for most cons.  However, it is nice to only spend a two days there as opposed to the entire four days.  I think I’m becoming entirely too anti-social to be surrounded by that many people for that long.</p>

<p>So I escape to hide from sunlight and humanity until PAX next year.</p>

          <p>I don’t drink coffee in the morning. (There, now that I’ve scared off most of you, I can be frank here on my little slice of the Internet.)</p>

<p>I did, however, get up this morning and drag my bones to PAX East with my wife. The gruff bastard that is New England weather behaved itself for at least as long as it took to get us to the convention center.  There the wind made of up the difference and peeled my skin down to the aforementioned bones.</p>

<p>The con, however, was lovely.</p>
