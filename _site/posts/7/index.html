          <p>Been doing a lot of development work lately.  Because of that, it would really suck to have to reconfigure all of my tools if I had a system failure.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on a backup system for my <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/tutorials/">dotfiles</a>. This is something I’ve been looking into for a while and didn’t know that it had an actually name until recently. It’s kind of an interesting movement in development.</p>

<p>I’ll probably link to my back up repo on here with an explanation of how I set everything up once I have something workable.</p>

          <p>Still have a lot of prep left to do, but we have D&amp;D today. I’ve been calling these days “Game Day” for a while, and it’s funny how often people ask me what kind of sports I’m watching.</p>

<p>Sports and I waved good bye to each other years ago, and I haven’t looked back since.  I mean, I will still watch Hockey every now and then. But that’s not sports, that’s religion.</p>

<p>Anyway, will be prepping and playing all day.  Tomorrow is back to coding.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just have to make an internal calendar for your D&amp;D campaign. Been working on notes for the better part of the afternoon. Will probably need to put in another few hours in today and a few hours tomorrow before the game. Then it’s back to coding.</p>

          <p>Just set up feed syndication from this site to my twitter account and my new Author page on Facebook.  (Aren’t I just the fanciest.)</p>

<p>The goal is to have a post from here syndicated everywhere automatically, so that this site become the main repository for my digital life and as-they-happen thoughts.</p>

<p>Still hacking in features to the site, but will be adding new post types soon once the actual development reaches a stoping point.  (Or at least as much as a stopping point as I’m likely to get.)</p>

<p>However, it’s getting to the point where every time the weather gets nice all I can think about is “the world is dying.” So yeah, I’m cheery today.</p>

<p>Have some planing for my D&amp;D session coming up and might pick at some more problems I have with this site. Also, might get all my Internet locations around if I can be asked.</p>

<p>This is the current stock of notebooks that I have.  (Well sort of, there is another Lichtenstein 1917 floating around here somewhere, but I think my den has eaten it.)</p>

<p>I think to be a writer, you have to have a stationary fetish on some level.  Since college, I’ve been a Moleskine guy. They’re sturdy and say “look at me, I’m fancy,” which when you’re the only one reading your writing, sometimes you need.</p>

<p>But things have changed since I was in college - like the Earth’s crust cooled and not everything is sepia toned. So I’m trying to branch out at try the other two big notebook makers: Lichtenstein 1917 and Field Notes. And by “branch out” I mean buy them and not write in them.</p>

<p>So I’m doing a notebook freeze until I use some of the one’s I have. (Yes, I bought the Field Notes today. Shut up!)</p>

<p>In the interest of testing out some of the other types of notebooks I have, I’m going to break them up into themes.  I’m going to use the Field Notes as a daily driver for small, quick notes and to do lists.  The Lichtenstein 1917 I think will be best served as a Reflection Journal.  Basically a series of questions I’ll answer each month. (Need to work out what those are. Might publish the questions - not the answers - on here.)</p>

<p>The hard back Moleskine is already a traditional journal that I almost never write in, and the big soft cover is my DM’s journal for D&amp;D.</p>

<p>The others are just going to stay surplus for now.  And before you @ with “Bullet Journal! Bullet Journal!” I’ll have you know that I was also doing that before the Earth’s crust cooled, and it doesn’t work with my current workflow at the moment.  Plus hasn’t that kind of morphed into scrap booking now?</p>

          <p>Woke up earlier than is recommended for a human.  I’m in that weird half stage where my body can’t decide if it wants to take a nap or run a marathon. Not sure how the day is going to go.</p>

<p>Going to take an inventory of all the notebooks I have in the house and get them into some kind of system today.</p>

<p>Also, I’m going to have to manually drop the link to this post into Facebook because they have defeated any automation for their profiles because that totally was the issue everyone has with Facebook.</p>

          <p>Decided to break the update into multiple posts because the last one ended well.</p>

<p>Finished up some important things that I needed to take care of today.  Then went for a walk with the wife, so she could pick up some library books.</p>

<p>Now time to hide back in my hole and work on this site some more.  I’ve connected a CMS to it so now I have proper writing environment, so there should be no more typos. (We’ll see…)</p>

<p>This week is going to taken up with finishing this site, working on some content for D&amp;D, and killing the monster that my email has turned into.</p>

          <p>Software has been on my brain a lot lately.  In no small part thanks to building this site.  It’s been a lot of reading people gushing over the concept of the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a>.</p>

<p>Which has me thinking that perhaps the only people who still have technology they love are programers.  It used to not be that way.  We used to get really excited about new technology: gadgets, software, games. (I’m an old, so I remember people standing in line for copies of Windows 95.)</p>

<p>Now we have things that are ubiquitous but nobody’s favorite. Nobody loves Facebook.  Contrary to the screaming echo chamber of hot takes, not everyone who uses it hates it, but no one is excited by the prospect of logging in.</p>

<p>I think we’re all just exhausted by technology around us.  We have to use it for work and are afraid we’ll be found out as not being The Best at it. Then we get home and find out that the “for fun” software on our phones are eroding the concept of personal privacy, or subverting democracy, or some such.</p>

<p>Put country plain: Technology is a support structure for life, but right now, I think we might have it the other way around.</p>
