Still making my way through this show.  Season three was really uneventful.  I kept reading episode synopsis and it just didn't look like anything I wanted at all.  So I moved to season 4 pretty quickly.  Turns out, that I have watched every episode so far.  

While I should be happy about that, I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.

We'll see.
