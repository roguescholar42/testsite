The last two days have been fairly pleasant and I've actually popped out of my hole while the Day Star was still high in the air. 

However, it's getting to the point where every time the weather gets nice all I can think about is "the world is dying." So yeah, I'm cheery today.

Have some planing for my D&D session coming up and might pick at some more problems I have with this site. Also, might get all my Internet locations around if I can be asked.
