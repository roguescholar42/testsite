Wil Wheaton said on his Facebook page recently that he's been getting a lot of people tweeting at him to let him know that they are spending their time in self isolation watching or re-watching Star Trek.  

That's kind of inspired me so I've been re-watching Star Trek Voyager.  So far, it's not as uneven as I remember.  But I've only re-watched a handful of episodes so far.  However, every time I see an interesting story line start to get teased out, my wife says, "Yeah, they don't go anywhere with that." 

But each episode I watch is pretty good in and of itself.  Maybe it's just the universe's way of telling me to live in the moment more.

Good advice for right now.
