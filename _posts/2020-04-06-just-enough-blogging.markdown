Popped back into my [Tumblr account](https://electricabacus.tumblr.com/) the other day.  I open it up in fits and starts, and every time I do, I'm always pleasantly surprised by what I find there.

I can always find some art or some kind of mood setter that makes me want to create art.  And the tool set for the Tumblr blog is perfectly suited to create the the kind of blog I want without paying for extra features.  

While you can create just about any kind of content you wanted on the platform, the tool set and audience have this nice synergy that creates a cerise of conventions that don't get too bogged down in elaborate pieces of content. Medium style posts don't work on their due to their length. Bitter, Facebook-style social engineering posts don't work due to the audience and lack of algorithmic support. 

Micro communities burbble up from the electric aether for a few hours and then collapse back down. Every post is judged on its own merits.  If it's good enough, it won't just be "liked", it will be re-blogged to other's pages and added back into the data-stream.  Keeping it alive and vital for a few more minutes or hours. 

Not everyone needs sometime like what I've built for self-expression. Sometimes the simple remix quality of the "reblog" button is just enough blogging.
