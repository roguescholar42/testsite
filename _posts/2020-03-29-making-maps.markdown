I've been making maps this entire day and lost track of time.  Almost didn't make a post today.  It's been raining here all day and it's really only been good for thinking about some other world and making a map for it. 

I'm not usually this kind of guy, but I've been enjoying the new Inkarnate interface and I can finally make it do what I want it to do.  

So that's good.
