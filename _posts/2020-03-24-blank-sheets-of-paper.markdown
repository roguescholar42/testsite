Finally broke down and cleaned the desk for the first time in a while.  Now it's a blank sheet of paper waiting for me to mess up again. 

I'll take some pictures of it once I consider it to be finished. But we aren't there yet.  I'm thinking about moving some of the desk furniture around because - well - I do have the time. 

Opened the screaming depression factory that is Facebook and regretted it immediately.  To be fair, this isn't a recent development on that site.  I believe it turned into a place where we communicate to each other over how helpless we feel long ago.  

So what I'm saying is that opening it is on me at this point.  I should know better.
