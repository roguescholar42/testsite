In my two main email accounts I get  a lot of junk.  I don't really clean it out or even check one of my accounts.  This is ironic because I've taught email productivity professionally for years. 

*The shoemaker's kids go barefoot*, and all that. 

My Inbox is at a massive number - which I will not share with internet - and I'm currently downloading all of my mail into Apple's desktop email app.  I was going to use Outlook, which I know a lot better, but Google has blocked all of the features that make that application useful.  In fact, the Apple app was able to use some basic organization features with Gmail that Outlook couldn't.  

Once the download is complete, the great email purge and reorganization begins.  I will post updates.
