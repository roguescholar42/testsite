Just got groceries and watched some TV with the wife.  There's not a lot of chatter outside the house.  Social Media is a different story.  People are posting memes but don't appear to be saying much of anything.

So I've stopped looking at Reddit and Facebook.  

I'm looking forward to another lazy Sunday.  Hope everything is quite for you.
