It's a lazy Sunday, which means I've been more productive than I've been all week, I just haven't left my bedroom much. 

I did the one thing I wanted to get done today, which was get the blog a proper URL.  Now I can actually start handing it out without the embarrassment that I'm building this site with my bare hands on the cheap. 

The light here in Witch City is starting to wane and I think it would be wise to go outside before the cold, brutal blanket of night comes in and any activity seem like something, "best left for tomorrow."
