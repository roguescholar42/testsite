It's that weird, misty day that only appears every four years because the Earth can't be asked to revolve around the sun in a way that's convenient to us with our arbitrary calendar system.

I like that. The earth is going to do what it wants and we just have to keep up with our measuring systems.  And we aren't doing the job at 100%, so we get a slightly longer year every now and then. One last day of February. 

There's some more coding research that I'm hoping to get done today, and I'd like to get a few more things taken care of on the backend of this blog before I'm willing to call it's setup complete. Luckily, I have an extra day.
