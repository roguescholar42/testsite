Still have a lot of prep left to do, but we have D&D today. I've been calling these days "Game Day" for a while, and it's funny how often people ask me what kind of sports I'm watching.

Sports and I waved good bye to each other years ago, and I haven't looked back since.  I mean, I will still watch Hockey every now and then. But that's not sports, that's religion. 

Anyway, will be prepping and playing all day.  Tomorrow is back to coding.
