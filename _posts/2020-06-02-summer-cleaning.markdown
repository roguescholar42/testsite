That's a thing right?

It's the first of the month, and I think I'm moving into a phase technology phase and will be rebuilding this site.  There's a few things on the site that I'm not 100% happy with, and the entire point of building your own blog from scratch is to be 100% happy with the outcome. 

I've been in an artistic phase, with lots of research of modular synths, but I can feel the next phase starting to raise. Mainly because I'm not in a place where I can pull the trigger on building my rig, so I'd like to move into something I can actually action on. 

This week is going to be a lot of pulling things together to start building test sites, and building some things out for my D&D campaign. 

**Note:** I've been quiet on here lately because I've been reading a lot of news and the current cycle has been the most horrifying in a while, and it's been hard for me to actually do anything.  But I'm trying to pull out of it. 

The good thing about this blog is that I'll have a log of how this all went after the fact.  Which is why I think this place deserves some care.
