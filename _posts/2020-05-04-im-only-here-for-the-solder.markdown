I think I've mentioned this before, but I've been looking a lot at modular synths.  However, the thing that interests me the most about them isn't their utility as an instrument, but the DIY community that has always been with them.  I've always wanted to get into that level of electronics, but have never had a good application for learning those skills.

Even though I was a fire alarm installer, I wasn't building the components directly.  It was a lot of cable pulls and wiring things directly to prebuilt junction points. 

So while I may never make any good music, I might make some interesting modules that could make good sounds if only I knew what the hell I was doing.
