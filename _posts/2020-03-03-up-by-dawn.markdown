Woke up earlier than is recommended for a human.  I'm in that weird half stage where my body can't decide if it wants to take a nap or run a marathon. Not sure how the day is going to go.

Going to take an inventory of all the notebooks I have in the house and get them into some kind of system today. 

Also, I'm going to have to manually drop the link to this post into Facebook because they have defeated any automation for their profiles because that totally was the issue everyone has with Facebook.
