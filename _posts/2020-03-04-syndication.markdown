Just set up feed syndication from this site to my twitter account and my new Author page on Facebook.  (Aren't I just the fanciest.) 

The goal is to have a post from here syndicated everywhere automatically, so that this site become the main repository for my digital life and as-they-happen thoughts. 

Still hacking in features to the site, but will be adding new post types soon once the actual development reaches a stoping point.  (Or at least as much as a stopping point as I'm likely to get.)
