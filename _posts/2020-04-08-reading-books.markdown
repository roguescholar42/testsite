Most of today has been spent in books.  I've plowed through two deluxe hardcovers of Battle Angel Alita.  I've read the series before. In fact, Alita was one of the first comics I ever read. I even have old trades of it that are read the western left to right instead of the eastern right to left.  Yes, Grandpa Millennial is older than you thought.  It was quite on fleek.
