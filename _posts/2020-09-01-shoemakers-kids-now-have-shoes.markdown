I finally finished backing up my config files for my dev tools and syncing them across all my computers.  I have be putting it off for a while because I always feel like I could brick something when I'm working on stuff like that.

And yes, I did almost lose my terminal interface, but you know, I fixed it at the last second.

Now that I have a syncing solution I can start really getting into customizing my dev environment.  Which probably won't end with me bricking my rig again.
