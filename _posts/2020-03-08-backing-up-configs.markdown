Been doing a lot of development work lately.  Because of that, it would really suck to have to reconfigure all of my tools if I had a system failure. 

I'm currently working on a backup system for my [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/tutorials/). This is something I've been looking into for a while and didn't know that it had an actually name until recently. It's kind of an interesting movement in development.

I'll probably link to my back up repo on here with an explanation of how I set everything up once I have something workable.
