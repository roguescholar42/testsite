It's colder in the house than I'd like, but not so cold that I'm actually going to do anything about it.  My news feeds were also bothering me so I did do something about them.

Now my propensity for doing things is shot.

Today was a lot of dealing with my tooling.  I managed to get some back programs to actually work and I went through the arduous process of getting all the applications on my laptop ran though my package manager. This way I can get my secondary computers as well as future computers all on the same page.  

Yes, Macs are hearty things.  My MacBook Air is almost six years old, and while it is running fine for now, I did kill it stone dead last year and had to nurse it back to health. 

Making backups for my backups is making me happy right now so I'm going to keep chasing it.
