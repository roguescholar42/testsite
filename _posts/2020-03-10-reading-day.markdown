Been catching up on some reading lately.  Well that's not entirely true, I've been reorganizing my "to be read" shelf, which has grown into it's own book case and I've recharged the Kindle.  Probably going to spend the rest of the day with my head in a few books.  

Will most likely have a round up post on here when I resurface.
