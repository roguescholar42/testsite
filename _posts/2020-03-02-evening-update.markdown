Decided to break the update into multiple posts because the last one ended well. 

Finished up some important things that I needed to take care of today.  Then went for a walk with the wife, so she could pick up some library books. 

Now time to hide back in my hole and work on this site some more.  I've connected a CMS to it so now I have proper writing environment, so there should be no more typos. (We'll see...)

This week is going to taken up with finishing this site, working on some content for D&D, and killing the monster that my email has turned into.
