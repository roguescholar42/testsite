I don't drink coffee in the morning. (There, now that I've scared off most of you, I can be frank here on my little slice of the Internet.) 

I did, however, get up this morning and drag my bones to PAX East with my wife. The gruff bastard that is New England weather behaved itself for at least as long as it took to get us to the convention center.  There the wind made of up the difference and peeled my skin down to the aforementioned bones. 

The con, however, was lovely.
