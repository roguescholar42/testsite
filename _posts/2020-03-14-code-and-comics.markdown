Finally managed to beat my new Jekyll layout into shape.  There's a lot more I have to do to it before I can start using it for the site, but at least it actually works as a layout now. 

Started reading Punk Rock Jesus last night and could not put it down until I was finished.  Some of the most fun I've had with comics in a while.  The writing was every tight and would let you look away, and the art was like the best sketches done while you should have been paying attention in class. 

But I do have one nitpick: in a comic called Punk Rock Jesus - where you are reference actual punk bands and have a main character who is actively trying to take down religion - why don't you mention Bad Religion or show the cross buster logo even once?

Again, this is a nitpick, but it's one that a punk would totally make.
