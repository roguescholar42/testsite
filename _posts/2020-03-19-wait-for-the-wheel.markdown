Today has been a bit of a wash.  I was looking at the news and that's taken a bit out of me. But tomorrow will be better.  I'm going to get back to a web development course tomorrow, so maybe we can both look forward to a slightly better design for the site.

A fresh redesign might be what we all need right now.
