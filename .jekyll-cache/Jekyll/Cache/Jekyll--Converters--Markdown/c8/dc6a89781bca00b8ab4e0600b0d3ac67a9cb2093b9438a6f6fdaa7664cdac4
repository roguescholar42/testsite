I"Ê<p>When I got into comics in the fall of 2000, it wasnâ€™t too long until I walked backwards into Vertigo Comics.  For anyone that doesnâ€™t know, Vertigo Comics was an imprint of DC where they put all of their â€œAdultâ€ titles.  In comic parlance, adult means boobs, blood, swears, and big ideas.</p>

<p>Think if HBO only did lurid genera stuff.  Itâ€™s everything EC Comics ever wanted to be, but thatâ€™s another story for another day.</p>

<p>Vertigo is gone now.  Phased out this year - after itâ€™s near decade long death-throws - for the new DC Black Label.  (At least for now.)</p>

<p>It took me longer than Iâ€™m proud of to realize that all the comics I was collecting at the time -  Transmetropolitan, Preacher, and The Invisibles - were from the same publisher.  After that, I would buy books because they had the Vertigo name on them. It was a name that implied taste.  (Or lack there of, depending on who you asked.)</p>

<p>So time has gone on and Vertigo, before it was finally killed of, re-collected most of their series into large volumes that make up two to three of the ones I already have.  Some of these series Iâ€™ve either never fully finished getting: 100 Bullets, Y The Last Man. Or Iâ€™ve had some volumes damaged from over use: Transmetropolitan, The Invisibles. So Iâ€™ve started to buy the deluxe volumes and getting rid of the old.</p>

<p>And of course I canâ€™t just bring these into the house and put them on the shelf, I have to read them first.  Which has been really nice to re-read some of my favorite stories.  I finished Transmetropolitan - even though not all the deluxe volumes are out for that - and Iâ€™m currently working on 100 Bullets.  Which I never actually read all of.  Iâ€™m still in stuff Iâ€™ve already read, but Iâ€™ll be getting to â€œnewâ€ stuff soon.  So thatâ€™s exciting.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been nice going back through these hard, little nuggets of angry tales.  If anything, itâ€™s kept be for doomscrolling through the news.</p>
