I"@<p>It’s a lazy Sunday, which means I’ve been more productive than I’ve been all week, I just haven’t left my bedroom much.</p>

<p>I did the one thing I wanted to get done today, which was get the blog a proper URL.  Now I can actually start handing it out without the embarrassment that I’m building this site with my bare hands on the cheap.</p>

<p>The light here in Witch City is starting to wane and I think it would be wise to go outside before the cold, brutal blanket of night comes in and any activity seem like something, “best left for tomorrow.”</p>
