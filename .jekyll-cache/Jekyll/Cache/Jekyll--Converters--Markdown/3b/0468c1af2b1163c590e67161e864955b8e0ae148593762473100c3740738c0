I"™<p>Iâ€™ve been making maps this entire day and lost track of time.  Almost didnâ€™t make a post today.  Itâ€™s been raining here all day and itâ€™s really only been good for thinking about some other world and making a map for it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not usually this kind of guy, but Iâ€™ve been enjoying the new Inkarnate interface and I can finally make it do what I want it to do.</p>

<p>So thatâ€™s good.</p>
