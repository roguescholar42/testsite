I"0<p>When I got into comics in the fall of 2000, it wasn’t too long until I walked backwards into Vertigo Comics.  For anyone that doesn’t know, Vertigo Comics was an imprint of DC where they put all of their “Adult” titles.  In comic parlance, adult means boobs, blood, swears, and big ideas.</p>
