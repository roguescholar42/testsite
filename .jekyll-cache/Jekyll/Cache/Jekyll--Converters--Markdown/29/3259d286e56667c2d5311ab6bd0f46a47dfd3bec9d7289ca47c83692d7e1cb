<p>This is the current stock of notebooks that I have.  (Well sort of, there is another Lichtenstein 1917 floating around here somewhere, but I think my den has eaten it.)</p>

<p>I think to be a writer, you have to have a stationary fetish on some level.  Since college, Iâ€™ve been a Moleskine guy. Theyâ€™re sturdy and say â€œlook at me, Iâ€™m fancy,â€ which when youâ€™re the only one reading your writing, sometimes you need.</p>

<p>But things have changed since I was in college - like the Earthâ€™s crust cooled and not everything is sepia toned. So Iâ€™m trying to branch out at try the other two big notebook makers: Lichtenstein 1917 and Field Notes. And by â€œbranch outâ€ I mean buy them and not write in them.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m doing a notebook freeze until I use some of the oneâ€™s I have. (Yes, I bought the Field Notes today. Shut up!)</p>

<p>In the interest of testing out some of the other types of notebooks I have, Iâ€™m going to break them up into themes.  Iâ€™m going to use the Field Notes as a daily driver for small, quick notes and to do lists.  The Lichtenstein 1917 I think will be best served as a Reflection Journal.  Basically a series of questions Iâ€™ll answer each month. (Need to work out what those are. Might publish the questions - not the answers - on here.)</p>

<p>The hard back Moleskine is already a traditional journal that I almost never write in, and the big soft cover is my DMâ€™s journal for D&amp;D.</p>

<p>The others are just going to stay surplus for now.  And before you @ with â€œBullet Journal! Bullet Journal!â€ Iâ€™ll have you know that I was also doing that before the Earthâ€™s crust cooled, and it doesnâ€™t work with my current workflow at the moment.  Plus hasnâ€™t that kind of morphed into scrap booking now?</p>
