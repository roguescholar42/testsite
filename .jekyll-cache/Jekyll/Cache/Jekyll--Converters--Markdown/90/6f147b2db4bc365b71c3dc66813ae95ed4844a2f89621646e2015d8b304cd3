I"L<p>It’s colder in the house than I’d like, but not so cold that I’m actually going to do anything about it.  My news feeds were also bothering me so I did do something about them.</p>

<p>Now my propensity for doing things is shot.</p>

<p>Today was a lot of dealing with my tooling.  I managed to get some back programs to actually work and I went through the arduous process of getting all the applications on my laptop ran though my package manager. This way I can get my secondary computers as well as future computers all on the same page.</p>

<p>Yes, Macs are hearty things.  My MacBook Air is almost six years old, and while it is running fine for now, I did kill it stone dead last year and had to nurse it back to health.</p>

<p>Making backups for my backups is making me happy right now so I’m going to keep chasing it.</p>
