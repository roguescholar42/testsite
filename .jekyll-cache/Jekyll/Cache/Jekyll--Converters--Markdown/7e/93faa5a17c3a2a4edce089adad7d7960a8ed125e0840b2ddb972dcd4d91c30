I"j<p>So I may be becoming an old man.  I was scrolling Facebook and the algorithm and figured out that I will always stop whenever thereâ€™s a video of someone making a craft, or building a table, or something.  I never told it this.  I never shared anything like this, or clicked the like button on a video. It just figured it out from my scrolling behavior.</p>
