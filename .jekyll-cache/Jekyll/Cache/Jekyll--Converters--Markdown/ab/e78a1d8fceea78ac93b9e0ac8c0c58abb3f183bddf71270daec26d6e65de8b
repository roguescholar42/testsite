I"‘<p>Thatâ€™s a thing right?</p>

<p>Itâ€™s the first of the month, and I think Iâ€™m moving into a phase technology phase and will be rebuilding this site.  Thereâ€™s a few things on the site that Iâ€™m not 100% happy with, and the entire point of building your own blog from scratch is to be 100% happy with the outcome.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been in an artistic phase, with lots of research of modular synths, but I can feel the next phase starting to raise. Mainly because Iâ€™m not in a place where I can pull the trigger on building my rig, so Iâ€™d like to move into something I can actually action on.</p>

<p>This week is going to be a lot of pulling things together to start building test sites, and building some things out for my D&amp;D campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Iâ€™ve been quiet on here lately because Iâ€™ve been reading a lot of news and the current cycle has been the most horrifying in a while, and itâ€™s been hard for me to actually do anything.  But Iâ€™m trying to pull out of it.</p>

<p>The good thing about this blog is that Iâ€™ll have a log of how this all went after the fact.  Which is why I think this place deserves some care.</p>
