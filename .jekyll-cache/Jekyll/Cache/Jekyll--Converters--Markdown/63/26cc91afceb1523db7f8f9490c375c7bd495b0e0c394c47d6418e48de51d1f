I"Í<p>Iâ€™ve reached the stage where Iâ€™ve moved a lot of the standing clutter out but it looks like Iâ€™ve changed nothing because it was all in out of the way places.  In fact, there are a few boxes floating around here that werenâ€™t here before.  Moral is low, and enthusiasm is starting to run out.</p>

<p>Will have to move onto shear willpower from here on out.  Weâ€™ll see how this plays out. Pretty tired right now, and my back is starting to bother me.  Probably going to throw on some youtube and see if I can start taking care of the Warhammer 40k and arts and crafts shelf.  (Yes, I know those two things probably shouldnâ€™t be lumped together, but you now see why I had to go through this exercise.</p>
