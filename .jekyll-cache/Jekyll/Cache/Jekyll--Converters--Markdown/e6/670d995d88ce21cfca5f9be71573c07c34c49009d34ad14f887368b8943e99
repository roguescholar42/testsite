I"t<p>I think I’ve mentioned this before, but I’ve been looking a lot at modular synths.  However, the thing that interests me the most about them isn’t their utility as an instrument, but the DIY community that has always been with them.  I’ve always wanted to get into that level of electronics, but have never had a good application for learning those skills.</p>
