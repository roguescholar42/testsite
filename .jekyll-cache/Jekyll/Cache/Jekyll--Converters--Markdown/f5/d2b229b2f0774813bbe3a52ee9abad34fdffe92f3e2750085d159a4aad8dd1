I"ƒ<p>So Iâ€™m trying out another productivity system.  Anyone who knows me is probably rolling their eyes because productivity systems is something of a hobby of mine, which is a nice way of saying I read a lot without doing much.  The thing thatâ€™s unique about this one is that Iâ€™m building it myself out of bits from other systems.  Just the bits I like and Iâ€™m exited to use.</p>
