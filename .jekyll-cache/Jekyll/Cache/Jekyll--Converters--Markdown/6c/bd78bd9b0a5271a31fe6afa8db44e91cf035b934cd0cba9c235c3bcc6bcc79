I"å<p>Still have a lot of prep left to do, but we have D&amp;D today. Iâ€™ve been calling these days â€œGame Dayâ€ for a while, and itâ€™s funny how often people ask me what kind of sports Iâ€™m watching.</p>

<p>Sports and I waved good bye to each other years ago, and I havenâ€™t looked back since.  I mean, I will still watch Hockey every now and then. But thatâ€™s not sports, thatâ€™s religion.</p>

<p>Anyway, will be prepping and playing all day.  Tomorrow is back to coding.</p>
