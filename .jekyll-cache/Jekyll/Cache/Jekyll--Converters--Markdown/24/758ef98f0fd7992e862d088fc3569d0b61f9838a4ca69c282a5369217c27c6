I"√	<p>I jumped into the SiteLeaf account to write about running this site for a month and posting every day.  Turns out that was yesterday.</p>

<p>That pretty much tells you everything you need to know about how things have been going, but it‚Äôs my blog damn it and I can be a long winded as I want.</p>

<p>Posting every day really hasn‚Äôt been that big of a deal and I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôve been able to fold it into my time fairly easily.  When I go to write, I don‚Äôt dread it as I‚Äôve done with other ‚Äúblogging challenges.‚Äù</p>

<p>I put that in quotes because back in the day I used to give my self challenges to write every day for a month.  I would make a big deal of it and I would write a review of each week during the challenge. And it was always a slog.  In fact, I only finished one of those challenges once.</p>

<p>I thought the reason for this was that I was lazy.  Turns out that was wrong.  The fact that I wouldn‚Äôt write much on the blog was that I was building it up in my mind too much.  It had to be too perfect.  On my old blog, I was writing what I hoped were full articles and not simple posts.  (These are very different in my mind.  One is much more formal while the other is a simple update that you could see on any social media service.)</p>

<p>What I‚Äôm trying to do with this site is a simple sketch pad for me be play with ideas in a public space and to be a signaling system for what I‚Äôm working on each day. That every simple mission statement takes a lot of pressure off of me to be perfect and allows be the freedom to just get on with it.</p>

<p>I look forward to updating this site and have done some multiple times in a day, which was unthinkable on my last blog.  This, to me, is the purest expression of what blogging is: personal updates about what‚Äôs happening in a persons life right now. Writing online should be about freedom and not a dreaded chore.</p>

<p>Because of that, I think I‚Äôve actually written a few posts that are of some interest and would have had a place at my old blog, but I have been posting them at a higher frequency than I ever did on my other site.</p>

<p>This all said, I‚Äôve written enough of these self-congratulatory posts to fear what comes next: the months long silence followed by the ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a while‚Äù post. Somehow I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have to worry about that this time, but we‚Äôll see. All I can do is open this window again, sooner rather than later, and start typing. No pressure.</p>
