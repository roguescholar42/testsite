<p>This pen holder makes me happier than it has any right too.  Before I got it two days ago, about half of this was in a pencil cup Iâ€™ve had since college.  That has been tossed and now I can hold way more in about the same footprint.</p>

<p>I am by no means an artist, but getting one or two artistsâ€™ tools can greatly improve your life.</p>

<p>Now, at the corner of my desk is a little bit of order in the universe.  A place for everything and everything in itâ€™s place.  The way things are right now, I could use a little bit of that.</p>
