I"I<p>Been doing a lot of development work lately.  Because of that, it would really suck to have to reconfigure all of my tools if I had a system failure.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on a backup system for my <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/tutorials/">dotfiles</a>. This is something I’ve been looking into for a while and didn’t know that it had an actually name until recently. It’s kind of an interesting movement in development.</p>

<p>I’ll probably link to my back up repo on here with an explanation of how I set everything up once I have something workable.</p>
