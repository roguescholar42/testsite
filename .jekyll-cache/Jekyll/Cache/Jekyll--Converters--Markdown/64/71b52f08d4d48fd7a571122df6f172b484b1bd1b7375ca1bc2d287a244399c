I"b<p>So I’ve been living with my <a href="https://goodmorningsoda.com/2020/07/27/new-productivity-system/">new productivity system</a> for about a week and a half now. It’s been good but I still need to work some bugs out of the system.  I wasn’t able to clear off everything from The Board last week.  I think this was due to my ambition problem whenever I implement a new system. I try to put EVERY TASK EVER IN MY LIFE into it and I get overloaded and explode.</p>

<p>So I need to live with the system for a while before I really start seeing changes.  This is why I haven’t really written in up yet, so that I can get it into a better state before explaining how it works. Or just drop it because it doesn’t work for me.</p>

<p>For now, I just have to keep trying, but The Board has been reset, and we’ll see where the rest of the week takes us.</p>
