I"À<p>Finally broke down and cleaned the desk for the first time in a while.  Now itâ€™s a blank sheet of paper waiting for me to mess up again.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll take some pictures of it once I consider it to be finished. But we arenâ€™t there yet.  Iâ€™m thinking about moving some of the desk furniture around because - well - I do have the time.</p>

<p>Opened the screaming depression factory that is Facebook and regretted it immediately.  To be fair, this isnâ€™t a recent development on that site.  I believe it turned into a place where we communicate to each other over how helpless we feel long ago.</p>

<p>So what Iâ€™m saying is that opening it is on me at this point.  I should know better.</p>
