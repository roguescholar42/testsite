I"‰<p>I have five huge deluxe edition comic collections sitting on my coffee table unread, mocking me. Iâ€™m still making my way through 100 Bullets and itâ€™s still very good.  Thereâ€™s just a lot of it. Thereâ€™s 100 issues because Brian Azzarello likes to be cute.  Iâ€™ve read over 60 issues of it, which is where a lot of Vertigo series liked to end.  This means that the story is feeling like itâ€™s dragging just because itâ€™s now outside of the normal rhythm.</p>

<p>And after that I have Y The Last Man lined up.</p>

<p>So Am I reading any of this? Fuck no, Iâ€™m on like looking at volumes of Judge Dredd.  Itâ€™s a comic Iâ€™ve always lusted after as itâ€™s hard to get here in the states.  Or at least it was when I was a kid and really wanted to read it. Now theyâ€™ve collected it into huge volumes that I can go through in chronological order.</p>

<p>Because I need a bigger backlog.</p>
