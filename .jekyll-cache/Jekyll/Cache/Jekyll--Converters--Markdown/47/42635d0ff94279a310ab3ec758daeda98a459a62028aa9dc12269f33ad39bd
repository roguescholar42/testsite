I"k<p>Still hacking away at the email.  In the late 00’s there was a term called “bacon” that was spam that you signed up for.  It fell out of usage quickly but it applies here. I have tens of thousands of bacon emails that I’ve had to sift through.  I have uncovered and processed some actionable emails from my burner email address that I never check.</p>
