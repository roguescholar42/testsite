I"Ï<p>Daylight Savings Time happened yesterday, although Iâ€™ve never counted that Sunday as the first day.  Monday is always the first day of Daylight Savings Time to me.  The thing isnâ€™t real until you have to get up at the wrong time with shit to do.  Whatâ€™s this time shift look like when you have an agenda?</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea why we as a global society willingly give ourselves jet lag two times a year.  Yeah, yeah, I know. â€œSomething, something. Farmers.â€ But Iâ€™ve reached a point in my life where the only people I let say that to me are people who actually know farmers.</p>

<p>Do you know farmers? Have you farmed? Can you grow anything?</p>

<p>See. Jet lag. Makes people grumpy.</p>
