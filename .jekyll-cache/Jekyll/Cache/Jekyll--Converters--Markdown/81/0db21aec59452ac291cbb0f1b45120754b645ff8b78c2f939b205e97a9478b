I"Ø<p>So Iâ€™ve been living with my <a href="https://goodmorningsoda.com/2020/07/27/new-productivity-system/">new productivity system</a> for about a week and a half now. Itâ€™s been good but I still need to work some bugs out of the system.  I wasnâ€™t able to clear off everything from The Board last week.  I think this was due to my ambition problem whenever I implement a new system. I try to put EVERY TASK EVER IN MY LIFE into it and I get overloaded and explode.</p>
