I"Æ<p>I think Iâ€™ve mentioned this before, but Iâ€™ve been looking a lot at modular synths.  However, the thing that interests me the most about them isnâ€™t their utility as an instrument, but the DIY community that has always been with them.  Iâ€™ve always wanted to get into that level of electronics, but have never had a good application for learning those skills.</p>

<p>Even though I was a fire alarm installer, I wasnâ€™t building the components directly.  It was a lot of cable pulls and wiring things directly to prebuilt junction points.</p>

<p>So while I may never make any good music, I might make some interesting modules that could make good sounds if only I knew what the hell I was doing.</p>
