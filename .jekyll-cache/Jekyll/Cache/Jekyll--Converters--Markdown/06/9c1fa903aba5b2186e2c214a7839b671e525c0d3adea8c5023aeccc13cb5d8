I"[<p>All email is processed, moved into its correct folder or deleted outright.  In the last two days I have gone through thousands of emails that were of no consequence and only distracted from the mail I actually needed to see.  This is why people hate email and are intimidated by the internet in general.</p>

<p>I probably should have something more clever to say about that, but I’m tired.  Will be back online tomorrow after a good nights rest.</p>

<p>Note: while I was typing this, a new email came in… It’s been processed, but I think that says more about this situation than I could.</p>
