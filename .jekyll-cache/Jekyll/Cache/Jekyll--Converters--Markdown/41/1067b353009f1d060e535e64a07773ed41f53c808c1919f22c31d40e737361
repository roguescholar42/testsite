I"ý<p>I finally finished backing up my config files for my dev tools and syncing them across all my computers.  I have be putting it off for a while because I always feel like I could brick something when Iâ€™m working on stuff like that.</p>

<p>And yes, I did almost lose my terminal interface, but you know, I fixed it at the last second.</p>

<p>Now that I have a syncing solution I can start really getting into customizing my dev environment.  Which probably wonâ€™t end with me bricking my rig again.</p>
