I"×<p>I have five huge deluxe edition comic collections sitting on my coffee table unread, mocking me. Iâ€™m still making my way through 100 Bullets and itâ€™s still very good.  Thereâ€™s just a lot of it. Thereâ€™s 100 issues because Brian Azzarello likes to be cute.  Iâ€™ve read over 60 issues of it, which is where a lot of Vertigo series liked to end.  This means that the story is feeling like itâ€™s dragging just because itâ€™s now outside of the normal rhythm.</p>
