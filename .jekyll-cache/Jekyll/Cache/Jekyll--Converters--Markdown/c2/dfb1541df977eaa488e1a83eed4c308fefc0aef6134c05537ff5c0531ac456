I"É<p>Still hacking away at the email.  In the late 00â€™s there was a term called â€œbaconâ€ that was spam that you signed up for.  It fell out of usage quickly but it applies here. I have tens of thousands of bacon emails that Iâ€™ve had to sift through.  I have uncovered and processed some actionable emails from my burner email address that I never check.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also installed even more email filters in Gmail so I should actually start seeing actionable things easier from that account. But Gmail makes it just tedious enough to make filters that you donâ€™t want to do it all the time.  So I might be back in this boat in a few months.  Weâ€™ll see.  Google makes this a bit of a moving target.</p>
