I"Ù<p>Today was the last day Iâ€™ll be spending at PAX East this year. The show was great and everyone there is friendly and there is always a party atmosphere, which is more than can be said for most cons.  However, it is nice to only spend a two days there as opposed to the entire four days.  I think Iâ€™m becoming entirely too anti-social to be surrounded by that many people for that long.</p>

<p>So I escape to hide from sunlight and humanity until PAX next year.</p>
