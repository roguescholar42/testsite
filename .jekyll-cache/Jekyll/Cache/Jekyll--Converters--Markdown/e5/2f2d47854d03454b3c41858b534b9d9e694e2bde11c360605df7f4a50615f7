I"«<p>Itâ€™s that weird, misty day that only appears every four years because the Earth canâ€™t be asked to revolve around the sun in a way thatâ€™s convenient to us with our arbitrary calendar system.</p>

<p>I like that. The earth is going to do what it wants and we just have to keep up with our measuring systems.  And we arenâ€™t doing the job at 100%, so we get a slightly longer year every now and then. One last day of February.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s some more coding research that Iâ€™m hoping to get done today, and Iâ€™d like to get a few more things taken care of on the backend of this blog before Iâ€™m willing to call itâ€™s setup complete. Luckily, I have an extra day.</p>
