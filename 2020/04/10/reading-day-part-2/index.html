<p>Read a few more trades of Battle Angel Alita.  I’ve now moved onto Last Order.  It’s better than I remember, and the end of Battle Angel was even more of a let down.</p>

<p>“Let down” is a little harsh.  I heard the first cycle had to head early due to health reason on behalf of the author.  Of course, doing some quick research for this post has yielded nothing, so take that with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Anyway.  I’m quickly burning through my cache of trades and will have to do something once I run out of the books I have for this series. Probably going to get serious about buying digital comics.</p>
