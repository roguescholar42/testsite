<p>It’s my birthday.  And I’m not really one of those people who are on the other side of 30 and have decided that they don’t like their birthdays.</p>

<p>We age one second at a time, not one year at a time, so I didn’t all of a sudden gain a year because today is my birthday.  I think these days are good for self-reflection and deciding where to go next. You know, like what everybody says New Year’s Eve is for but no one ever does it.</p>

<p>That’s what I did today: thought about my past and future.</p>
