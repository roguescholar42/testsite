<p>So I’m currently downloading a new game to my computer: Disco Elysium.  Which students of obscure indie games will know as that game where you play as a drunk detective and the skills are all weird.</p>

<p>That’s about all I know too because I haven’t played it yet, but it’s about done being downloaded.  So if I drop off the world for a while, you know why.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to give computer games another shot because I actually have a computer that will run them, and they used to be my favorite part of video games.  They were always more deep and stranger than anything I could get on console.</p>

<p>I feel I may have stacked the deck in my PC’s favor with Disco Elysium.</p>
