<p>Just got groceries and watched some TV with the wife.  There’s not a lot of chatter outside the house.  Social Media is a different story.  People are posting memes but don’t appear to be saying much of anything.</p>

<p>So I’ve stopped looking at Reddit and Facebook.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to another lazy Sunday.  Hope everything is quite for you.</p>
