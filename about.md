You've reached the personal blog of **Josh Evans**.  This is a repository of my morning thoughts - not always in the morning. Just an overview of what I'm working on/thinking about. 

I'm a IT person and writer living in the Greater Boston area.  

Seeing as I'm interested in both technology and words, this site is going to be a constant work in progress. Please don't be alarmed if you point your browser here one day and the URL won't resolve.  I've either broken something beyond all hope of recovery, or I've finally said "to hell with it" and let the whole endeavor fall into the sea.

## Site's current tech setup:

- **Site Engine:** [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- **Theme:** Fairly modified version of [WhiteGlass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass)
- **Hosting:** [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- **CMS:** [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/)
- **Code Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/roguescholar42/roguescholar42.github.io)
