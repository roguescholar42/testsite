<p>Just finished season two of Altered Carbon and my thoughts on it are still fresh and unfinished.  It was really good, and a bit of a throw back to “hard R” sci-fi of the 80’s and early 90’s.  (Think Robocop and Total Recall.)</p>

<p>In fact, if I was 14, I think think this would be my favorite show and I wouldn’t be able to shut up about it.  As it stands, it’s very interesting to me how it approaches its place in sci-fi. I’ve read the first two books - the second of which this show totally ignores - and I would say they play very loose with their cyberpunk trappings.</p>

<p>Not so with the show.  It has cranked up the Cyberpunk themes about as high as they will go.  It is much more interested with social unrest, dehumanization, and how its technology actually works. These things were absolutely in the original novel but first and foremost that was a detective story. So seeing the show as a true interpretation and not a pale recreation is the main draw for me.</p>

<p>Also, given the state of things, there was some catharsis in seeing these themes played up more.</p>

          <p>Been doing a lot of development work lately.  Because of that, it would really suck to have to reconfigure all of my tools if I had a system failure.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on a backup system for my <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/tutorials/">dotfiles</a>. This is something I’ve been looking into for a while and didn’t know that it had an actually name until recently. It’s kind of an interesting movement in development.</p>

<p>I’ll probably link to my back up repo on here with an explanation of how I set everything up once I have something workable.</p>

          <p>Still have a lot of prep left to do, but we have D&amp;D today. I’ve been calling these days “Game Day” for a while, and it’s funny how often people ask me what kind of sports I’m watching.</p>

<p>Sports and I waved good bye to each other years ago, and I haven’t looked back since.  I mean, I will still watch Hockey every now and then. But that’s not sports, that’s religion.</p>

<p>Anyway, will be prepping and playing all day.  Tomorrow is back to coding.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just have to make an internal calendar for your D&amp;D campaign. Been working on notes for the better part of the afternoon. Will probably need to put in another few hours in today and a few hours tomorrow before the game. Then it’s back to coding.</p>

<p>This is the current stock of notebooks that I have.  (Well sort of, there is another Lichtenstein 1917 floating around here somewhere, but I think my den has eaten it.)</p>

<p>I think to be a writer, you have to have a stationary fetish on some level.  Since college, I’ve been a Moleskine guy. They’re sturdy and say “look at me, I’m fancy,” which when you’re the only one reading your writing, sometimes you need.</p>

<p>But things have changed since I was in college - like the Earth’s crust cooled and not everything is sepia toned. So I’m trying to branch out at try the other two big notebook makers: Lichtenstein 1917 and Field Notes. And by “branch out” I mean buy them and not write in them.</p>

<p>So I’m doing a notebook freeze until I use some of the one’s I have. (Yes, I bought the Field Notes today. Shut up!)</p>

<p>In the interest of testing out some of the other types of notebooks I have, I’m going to break them up into themes.  I’m going to use the Field Notes as a daily driver for small, quick notes and to do lists.  The Lichtenstein 1917 I think will be best served as a Reflection Journal.  Basically a series of questions I’ll answer each month. (Need to work out what those are. Might publish the questions - not the answers - on here.)</p>

<p>The hard back Moleskine is already a traditional journal that I almost never write in, and the big soft cover is my DM’s journal for D&amp;D.</p>

<p>The others are just going to stay surplus for now.  And before you @ with “Bullet Journal! Bullet Journal!” I’ll have you know that I was also doing that before the Earth’s crust cooled, and it doesn’t work with my current workflow at the moment.  Plus hasn’t that kind of morphed into scrap booking now?</p>

<p>Finished up some important things that I needed to take care of today.  Then went for a walk with the wife, so she could pick up some library books.</p>

<p>Now time to hide back in my hole and work on this site some more.  I’ve connected a CMS to it so now I have proper writing environment, so there should be no more typos. (We’ll see…)</p>

<p>This week is going to taken up with finishing this site, working on some content for D&amp;D, and killing the monster that my email has turned into.</p>
